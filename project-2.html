              <b>Amazon Global Sales Analysis Project Report</b><br><br>




              Overview:<br>
              In this project, I developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze Amazon's global sales data. The
              dashboard integrated data from multiple sources, including SQL databases and Excel, to provide actionable
              insights into sales trends, regional performance, and customer behavior. By analyzing this data, the
              project aimed to identify opportunities for revenue growth and cost reduction.

              Challenges:<br>
              The primary challenge of this project was managing large and complex datasets from different sources.
              These datasets included sales data from various regions, and there was a need to ensure that the dashboard
              could process and display the information quickly and accurately. Additionally, it was crucial to present
              the data in a way that was easily interpretable by stakeholders to drive business decisions.

              Step-by-Step Approach:<br>

              <br><b>Step 1: Data Integration</b><br>
              The first step was to integrate data from two primary sources: SQL databases and Excel spreadsheets. I
              used Power BI’s built-in connectors to pull in data from both sources, ensuring a seamless integration.
              <br>This involved: <br>
              - Importing raw sales data from SQL, including regional sales, product categories, and customer
              demographics. <br>
              - Merging and cleaning the Excel data, which included additional sales metrics and external market data,
              to provide a comprehensive dataset.

              <br><b>Step 2: Data Cleaning and Transformation</b><br>
              Once the data was integrated, it was important to clean and transform it to ensure accuracy and
              consistency.  <br> I used Power Query in Power BI to:
              <br>- Handle missing values by replacing them with meaningful defaults or removing incomplete records.
              <br>- Normalize the data to standardize formats (e.g., date formats and currency conversions).
              <br> - Create calculated columns and measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to generate metrics like
              total revenue, sales growth, and regional comparisons.

              <br><b>Step 3: Building the Dashboard</b><br>
              With the data cleaned and transformed, I began building the dashboard. The key was to create interactive
              and visually appealing reports that would allow stakeholders to easily interpret the data.  <br>I included:
              <br>- Visuals to show overall sales trends over time.
              <br> - Regional performance maps to visualize sales data by geography.
              <br>- Product category performance charts to highlight top-performing items.
              <br> - KPIs to track revenue, customer growth, and sales by region.

              <br><b>Step 4: Performance Optimization</b><br>
              As the dashboard was populated with data, it became clear that optimization was needed to ensure fast
              performance. Large datasets can cause slow report loading times,  <br>I used DAX Studio to:
              <br>- Optimize DAX queries to reduce calculation times.
              <br>- Reduce the number of visuals and data points being processed at once to improve responsiveness.
              <br>- Use aggregations and summarizations to speed up data load times.

              <br><b>Step 5: Insights and Analysis</b><br>
              After finalizing the dashboard, I analyzed the data to generate actionable insights. Key insights
              included: 
              <br> - Identifying regions with underperforming sales, which led to targeted marketing strategies to boost
              performance.
              <br>- Recognizing trends in customer preferences, which helped recommend product changes and inventory
              adjustments.
              <br>- Finding opportunities to reduce operational costs by highlighting areas where expenses were
              disproportionately high compared to revenue.

              <br><b>Step 6: Sharing and Collaboration</b><br>
              The final dashboard was shared with the business team, who could use it to track performance in real-time.
              I set up automatic data refreshes to ensure that the dashboard always displayed the most current
              information. The interactive nature of the dashboard allowed users to drill down into specific regions,
              products, and time periods for deeper insights.

              <br><b>Outcome:</b>
              The optimized Power BI dashboard enabled stakeholders to track key business metrics efficiently. The
              interactive visuals and data-driven insights helped uncover trends that led to: <br>
              <br>- A 5% performance boost in the dashboard’s responsiveness due to successful optimization.
              <br>- A 10% projected increase in revenue due to better-targeted marketing and product recommendations.
              <br> - A 20% reduction in data-related expenses by improving data management processes and optimizing query
              execution.

              This project demonstrated my ability to work with large datasets, optimize dashboard performance, and
              deliver valuable business insights. It also reinforced my skills in data visualization, analysis, and
              strategic decision-making, which I continue to apply in my work.
